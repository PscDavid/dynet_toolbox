Sparse Adaptive Least-squares Kalman Filtering +simulation +connectivity metrics

The complete collection of functions and scripts for estimating 
time-varying Multivariate Autoregressive processes (tv-MVAR)
by means of Kalman filtering and Sparse Adaptive Least-squares filtering.
The toolbox includes:
- The two main algorithms for state-space modeling of physiological time-series
- The simulation framework
- A set of connectivity metrics based on Partial Directed Coherence

Please refer to the file dynet_demo01 for a brief exhaustive tutorial.
A complete tutorial coming soon...
